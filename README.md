# DA-Net: Duirection Aware Network for Object Detection in Adverse Environment

DA-Net (Dual Enhancement Network) is an enhanced version of YOLO11 that incorporates advanced architectural modifications to improve object detection performance, particularly for challenging scenarios.

## Overview
    DA-Net builds upon YOLO11, introducing Dual Enhancement Blocks (DEB) and Local Directional Detection (LDD) blocks to enhance feature extraction and improve detection accuracy. The model maintains a lightweight architecture while providing superior performance compared to standard YOLO11.
